    "\n",
    "- The algorithms themselves will be evaluate to understand why their is a difference between them and a hypothesis will be formed.\n",

    "In an usnorted array, insertion sort works by taking an element ( List[index] ) in the array and iterating through the array while comparing the List[index] to the elements. Once an element is found to be greater than List[index], then the List[index] is placed before it. Usually, the sorting process starts with selecting the second element of the list (index = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be: \n",
    "- Iterate through the array comparing Array[index] to each element, until Array[index] < element \n",
    "- Placing it before the first element grater than it.\n",
    "- Moving the index to the following position (index += 1). \n",

This is considered a 'Divide and Conquer' method. Recursion is used to return the sorted subarrays to the next highest level subarray, before sorting and merging again.\n",
